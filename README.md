AToM-OpenMM
==============

The Alchemical Transfer Method for OpenMM (AToM-OpenMM) is an extensible Python package for the estimation of absolute and relative binding free energies of molecular complexes. It implements the [Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01129) with  asynchronous parallel replica exchange molecular dynamics with the [OpenMM](https://github.com/openmm) library. The AToM software can be deployed on workstations or cluster nodes with one or more GPUs.

AToM uses the [ATMetaForce plugin](https://github.com/Gallicchio-Lab/openmm-atmmetaforce-plugin) for OpenMM.

The asynchronous replica exchange method was first implemented in the [AsyncRE](https://github.com/ComputationalBiophysicsCollaborative/AsyncRE) package for the IMPACT program.

Installation & Usage
--------------------

It is recommended that the installation is performed in a personal python environment (`conda`, `miniconda`, or similar). AToM requires the `openmm`, `configobj` and `numpy` python modules. 

```
conda create -n atm -c conda-forge openmm openmm-atmmetaforce-plugin configobj setproctitle ambertools 
git clone https://github.com/Gallicchio-Lab/AToM-OpenMM.git
cd AToM-OpenMM
python setup.py install
```

`setproctitle` above is optional but useful to track the names of the processes started by AToM-OpenMM. The `ambertools` package is not an actual dependency but it is needed to set up some of the systems in the examples. See [examples](examples/) for examples and tutorials.

While we strive to develop and distribute high-quality and bug-free software, keep in mind that this is research software under heavy development. AToM is provided without any guarantees of correctness. Please report issues [here](https://github.com/Gallicchio-Lab/AToM-OpenMM/issues). We welcome contributions and pull requests.
