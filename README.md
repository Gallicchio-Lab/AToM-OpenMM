AToM-OpenMM v8.4
====================

![AToM logo](AToM-logo.png)

The Alchemical Transfer Method for OpenMM (AToM-OpenMM) is an extensible Python package for the estimation of absolute and relative binding free energies of molecular complexes. It implements the [Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01129) with  asynchronous parallel replica exchange molecular dynamics with the [OpenMM](https://github.com/openmm) library. The AToM software can be deployed on workstations or cluster nodes with one or more GPUs.

This version of AToM uses [ATMForce](https://github.com/openmm/openmm/pull/4110) in the 8.4.0 or later versions of [OpenMM](https://github.com/openmm/openmm).

Installation & Usage
--------------------

It is recommended that the installation is performed in a personal python environment (`miniforge`, `miniconda`, `conda`, or similar). AToM-OpenMM requires the `openmm`, `configobj` and `numpy` python modules. 

This version of AToM-OpenMM requires OpenMM 8.2.0 or later. This conda command installs the necessary requirements:
```
mamba create -n atm8.4.0 -c conda-forge 'openmm>=8.4' ambertools openmmforcefields configobj setproctitle r-base espaloma
mamba activate atm8.4.0
```
`setproctitle` above is optional but useful to track the names of the processes started by AToM-OpenMM. The `ambertools`, `openmmforcefields`, and `espaloma` packages are not actual dependencies; they are used to setup the molecular systems. `openmmforcefields`, in particular, is used to assign force field parameters using OpenFF, GAFF, or `espaloma`. [`espaloma`](https://github.com/choderalab/espaloma) is a machine-learning system by the Chodera lab to assign force field parameters.  `r-base` with the `UWHAM R package` (see below) is required for free energy estimation. See [examples](examples/) for examples and tutorials.

Finally, install AToM-OpenMM:

- From the latest sources:
```
git clone https://github.com/Gallicchio-Lab/AToM-OpenMM.git
cd AToM-OpenMM
pip install .
```

- From the latest release:
```
wget https://github.com/Gallicchio-Lab/AToM-OpenMM/archive/refs/tags/v8.4.0.tar.gz
tar zxvf v8.4.0.tar.gz
cd AToM-OpenMM-8.4.0
pip install .
```

And this will install the UWHAM R package:
```
Rscript -e 'install.packages("UWHAM", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")' 
```
